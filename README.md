[https://playspellbee.com](https://playspellbee.com)

**PlaySpellBee** is a minimalist word puzzle game inspired by the New York Times Spelling Bee — but it's completely **free** and **unlimited**.

Whether you're a casual word lover or a daily puzzle solver, PlaySpellBee lets you play without limits — no login, no paywalls, no ads.

## 🧠 How to Play

- You're given **7 letters**, one of which is mandatory (center letter).
- Make as many **valid English words** (4+ letters) as possible using the letters.
- All words must include the **center letter**.
- Try to find the **Pangram** — a word that uses all 7 letters.

- Lets you just open and play
